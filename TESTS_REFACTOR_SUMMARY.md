# Test Refactoring Summary

## What Was Done

Successfully split the monolithic `tests/molpha.ts` file into separate, organized test files:

### 📁 New Test Structure

```
tests/
├── setup.ts                           # Shared test utilities and setup
├── run-tests.ts                       # Test runner importing all split tests
├── README.md                          # Documentation for the test structure
├── instructions/                      # Individual instruction tests
│   ├── node-registry.test.ts         # initialize, addNode, removeNode
│   ├── create-data-source.test.ts     # createDataSource
│   ├── create-feed.test.ts            # createFeed
│   ├── permit.test.ts                 # permit, revokePermit
│   ├── feed-management.test.ts        # updateFeedConfig and related
│   ├── subscription.test.ts           # subscribe, topUp
│   └── signature-verification.test.ts  # verifySignatures, publishing
├── integration/                       # Integration tests
│   └── integration.test.ts            # End-to-end workflows
└── molpha.ts                          # Original file (kept for reference)
```

### 🔧 Shared Setup (`setup.ts`)

Extracted common functionality:
- `setupTestContext()` - Creates test context with program, PDAs, nodes, authority
- `initializeProtocol()` - Initializes node registry and protocol config
- Helper functions for creating test data sources and feeds
- EIP-712 signature utilities
- Test constants and sample data

### 📦 Package.json Scripts

Added new test scripts for running individual test suites:
```json
{
  "test:node-registry": "anchor test --skip-deploy tests/instructions/node-registry.test.ts",
  "test:create-data-source": "anchor test --skip-deploy tests/instructions/create-data-source.test.ts",
  "test:create-feed": "anchor test --skip-deploy tests/instructions/create-feed.test.ts",
  "test:permit": "anchor test --skip-deploy tests/instructions/permit.test.ts",
  "test:feed-management": "anchor test --skip-deploy tests/instructions/feed-management.test.ts",
  "test:subscription": "anchor test --skip-deploy tests/instructions/subscription.test.ts",
  "test:signature-verification": "anchor test --skip-deploy tests/instructions/signature-verification.test.ts",
  "test:integration": "anchor test --skip-deploy tests/integration/integration.test.ts",
  "test:instructions": "anchor test --skip-deploy tests/instructions/",
  "test:all": "anchor test"
}
```

## ✅ Test Results

When running the split tests:
- **17 tests passing** - Core functionality working correctly
- **16 tests failing** - Expected due to existing signature verification issues (not fixed as requested)
- **All test files load and run independently** - Structure is working correctly

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

1. **Modular Organization**: Each instruction has its own focused test file
2. **Easier Development**: Developers can run tests for specific instructions they're working on
3. **Better Maintainability**: Changes to one instruction's tests don't affect others
4. **Shared Setup**: Common test utilities prevent code duplication
5. **Faster Iteration**: Individual test files run faster than the full suite
6. **Clear Documentation**: README explains the structure and how to use it

## 🔄 Original File Status

- `tests/molpha.ts` - Kept for reference but has linter errors due to type mismatches
- The original tests can still be referenced but the new structure is recommended

## 🚀 Usage

Run individual instruction tests:
```bash
yarn test:node-registry
yarn test:create-feed
# etc.
```

Run all instruction tests:
```bash
yarn test:instructions
```

Run integration tests:
```bash
yarn test:integration
```

Run everything:
```bash
yarn test:all
```

## 📝 Notes

- Tests are designed to be independent but share common setup
- The `--skip-deploy` flag is used for faster execution when running individual files
- Some tests may fail due to existing signature verification issues in the original code
- The test structure is ready for development and can be extended as needed
